- Columns include: Total Cost, Room Type, Casino Expenses, Excursion Expenses, Customer Satisfaction, and more.

## 🔍 Key Steps
- Data cleaning and renaming columns
- Handling missing values and duplicates
- Visualizing room types and travel intent
- Grouping by room type to analyze costs
- Correlation heatmap of numerical features

## 📊 Tools Used
- Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- missingno for null value visualization

## 📈 Insights
- Balcony rooms had the highest total cost
- Customers who would travel again showed higher satisfaction
- Shipboard expenses varied significantly by room type

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Feature engineering for modeling
- Export cleaned dataset for Power BI dashboard
- Connect SQL queries to enhance analysis
